                        </div>
                        <p> I just recently finished an intensive Software engineering bootcamp
                            at <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/about-us/" target="_blank">HyperionDev</a>,
                            a challenging but really fun experience.</p> 
                        <p>I've always liked tinkering with digital tech and software. I previously
                            worked at Jaguar Land Rover as a technician. Being exposed to the advance electronics 
                            and software on the vehicles, I could no longer hold back on my constantly 
                            growing interest in the software world. My
                            personal goal is to contribute to the tech industry,
                            particularly in the African continent and other places where
                            tech could really do a lot to grow economies and change people's lives
                            for the better. </p> 
                        <p>I like taking on challenges, creating solutions and continuously learning as I believe that the direct relationship that
                            exists between effort and reward is fulfilling and one to strive for.
                            I am really interested in "Artificial Intelligence" that can help humanity
                            in countless ways, whether it be automation, productivity, disabilities or even mental health. 
                            Another goal currently underway is a personal
                            assistant AI that can take me to Pluto, for laughs.</p>
